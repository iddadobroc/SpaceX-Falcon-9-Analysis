This work provides an in-depth analysis of SpaceX rocket launches, focusing on the critical factors that contribute to their cost efficiency and success. 
SpaceX, a leader in the aerospace industry, advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches at a significantly lower cost of $62 million per mission, compared to over $165 million charged by other providers. 
A major factor behind this cost reduction is the reusability of the first stage of the rocket, a technological breakthrough that minimizes material waste and production expenses.
This report aims to explore the determinants of successful first-stage landings, as they are pivotal to cost reduction. 
By leveraging historical launch data, we analyze key variables such as payload mass, launch sites, booster versions, and mission outcomes to develop predictive models. 
These models can assist in determining the likelihood of a first-stage landing, thereby offering valuable insights into the potential cost of future launches.
In addition to understanding the economic implications of SpaceX's reusability strategy, this analysis highlights broader trends in the aerospace sector, such as the impact of innovation on reducing barriers to space exploration. 
Ultimately, this report serves as a foundation for further research into optimizing rocket launches and fostering sustainable advancements in space technology.
